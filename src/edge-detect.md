# Solve edge detection circuit!

- Focus on individual bit that gives wrong value.
- draw waveform diagram for in, register edgedetected and pedge
- trace the steps in verilog program to determine the waveform of register and i/o

0x24 = 0010 0100
0x81 = 1000 0001
0x09 = 0000 1001
0x63 = 0110 0011
0x0d = 0000 1101
